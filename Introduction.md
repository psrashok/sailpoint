### Basics of Identity Access Management

  - Identity and access management is the framework and processes organizations use to manage and secure digital identities and control user access to critical information.
  -  Systems include user registration, identity authentication, role-based access control, and compliance auditing and reporting.
  - Identity and access management systems protect sensitive data and systems from unauthorized access and breaches while also streamlining and automating the management of users’ digital identities, access permissions, and security policies.

  ##### Sailpoint LifeCycle Manager

      1. SailPoint Lifecycle Manager (LCM) is a product that helps manage identity and access to improve security, compliance, and reduce risk
      2. IdentityIQ Lifecycle Manager manages changes to user access and automates provisioning activities in your enterprise environment.\
      3. The Lifecycle Manager maps directly to the lifecycle of a user in an organization and the core identity business processes associated with the user lifecycle activities.
         
         * User Lifecycle Activities – joining, moving, leaving
         * Core Identity Processes – provision, change, de-provision

  The Lifecycle Manager can be configured to enable users to make requests through IdentityIQ and control which requests they can make.

    a. Users
            Individual User – can make requests using the self-service feature
            Managers – can make requests for direct reports
            Help Desk Operators – can make requests for populations
            Other users – controls requests by all users not a part of the standard groups

    b. User Requests 
            New access – request entitlement and roles
            Account Management – create, manage, and delete accounts including enable, disable, and unlock, change and reset passwords, and track current requests
            Identity Management – create, edit, and view identities

    c. Automated Change Management Using Configurable Event Triggers
            Lifecycle Manager provides automated change management based on configurable identity lifecycle event triggers.\
            These triggers are mapped to different identity-related events in an authoritative source, typically an human resources system.\ 
            When a tracked event is detected, provisioning requests are generated.

             > For Example
              ''' When the status of an employee changes from active to terminated, this lifecycle event can be configured to trigger a deprovisioning request for all of the access associate with the employee.\ 

            If an employee's job title changes, a trigger can launch the assignment of a new business role to replace the employee's current business role.'''

    d. IdentityIQ Governance Platform
        Lifecycle Manager leverages the IdentityIQ Governance Platform to enhance compliance performance, improve security, and reduce risk.\

        SailPoint uses a combination of roles, policy, and risk to provide a framework for evaluating all requests for changes to access against predefined business policies.

            - IdentityIQ Role Model – simplifies administration of user access by providing a predefined and planned structure for requesting and validating user access based on business or IT roles.

            - IdentityIQ Policy Model – evaluates your corporate access policies during the access request and provisioning processes.

            - IdentityIQ Risk Model – reduces operational risk by using a risk-based approach to identity governance and provisioning by enabling organizations to modify change management processes.


    e. Identity Provisioning Broker
        Lifecycle Manager uses the IdentityIQ Provisioning Broker to manage the final change manage activities that are the result of self-service access requests or automated lifecycle event triggers.\
        The IdentityIQ Provisioning Broker is a key piece of the IdentityIQ architecture that enables organizations to coordinate changes to user access across different provisioning processes.\
        When a provisioning change is triggered, the provisioning broker separates each request into its component parts and determines the appropriate provisioning implementation process. Provisioning options include:

          - The SailPoint Automated Change Manager
          - 3rd-party user provisioning solutions, such as Oracle IdM
          - Service request systems, such as BMC Remedy
          - Email generated to a system administrator


### Sailpoint Workflows
  1. A workflow is a set of steps that are completed every time a specific event occurs.
  2. Automatically performing a series of actions within your system that you can configure in response to a trigger.
  3. Workflows offer enormous flexibility, allowing you to configure a workflow to take very specific actions each time it runs.
  4. Workflows are managed using JSON and user interface.
